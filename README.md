# Post-installation script for Arch Linux and Debian

A simple script that will install my personal dotfiles on a base install of Arch Linux or Debian. The script assumes that you don't have pre-existing configurations, as those will be mercilessly overwritten. Run the script as a regular user that you intend to use the system as. Make sure you have sudo privileges.
